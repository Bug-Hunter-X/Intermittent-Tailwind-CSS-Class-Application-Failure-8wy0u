# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are inconsistently applied. Some classes work correctly, while others are ignored, seemingly at random. This issue is specific to certain components within a larger application.

## Bug Description
The core problem is that Tailwind classes fail to apply predictably.  Comprehensive checks of class names, syntax, and the build process have not identified the root cause. The intermittent nature of the problem makes debugging extremely challenging.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the development server (instructions may vary depending on your project setup). 
3. Observe that some Tailwind classes are applied while others are not on certain elements, especially within the 'ProblemComponent' section.

## Potential Causes (and why they were ruled out)
* **Typographical Errors:**  Meticulous review of class names eliminated this possibility.
* **Build Process Issues:**  The build process was thoroughly examined and found to be functioning correctly.
* **Conflicting CSS:**  No conflicting stylesheets were detected.
* **Caching:** Clearing browser caches and restarting the server had no effect.

## Solution (in bugSolution.html)
The solution might involve carefully examining the HTML structure and the surrounding CSS or potentially identifying a conflict with another library or custom CSS.  The 'fixed' component in the solution file shows a possible workaround or fix.
